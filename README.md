# notes-app

Built a notes app that runs in a web browser, as part of the Makers curriculum, using Javascript, Jest, HTML and CSS.

Includes a model class and a view class, allows for notes to be added to server and handles errors when refreshing the page without the server running, and also when attempting to save notes without the server running.
